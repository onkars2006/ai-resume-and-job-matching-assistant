## 📊 Resume Scoring Logic

| Factor                        | Weight |
| ----------------------------- | ------ |
| Length (1–2 pages)            | 20%    |
| Structure (standard sections) | 30%    |
| Role-specific Keywords        | 50%    |

AI also gives:

* Suggested job roles
* Skill gaps
* Line-by-line improvements
* Overall readiness score
